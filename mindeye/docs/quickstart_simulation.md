title: Quickstart for Simulated Real-Time MindEye
intro: 'Quickly set up and run real-time image reconstruction using pre-collected data.'
type: quick_start
---

## Introduction
This quickstart guide will walk you through the minimal setup to be able to start producing real-time reconstructions. This guide uses a standalone Jupyter notebook that isolates the real-time MindEye code from the RT-Cloud framework. 

This requires basic familiarity with Python, Git, and the command line. 

Use this as a first-pass to set up your environment, download the necessary files, and get familiar with the analysis pipeline. After this, you may want to proceed to quickstart_realtime.md to use the full RT-Cloud functionality with MindEye.

You have successfully completed this when you are able to run the main analysis loop and it begins generating image reconstructions.

## Setting up
In this section, we will install a uv environment and clone repositories containing the analysis code, data, and large files.

### Installing uv environment


{% comment %}
A step may require the user to perform several tasks - break those tasks down into chunks, allowing the user to scan quickly to find their place if they navigated away from this screen to perform the task.
An example might be creating a personal access token for the action to use and then storing it in secrets
For UI based tasks, include the button or options the users should click
If the task adds code, include the code in context (don't just show `needs setup` show the entire `setup` and `dependent` jobs)

## Next steps

{% comment %}
Provide a quick recap of what has been accomplished in the quick start as a means of transitioning to next steps. Include 2-3 actionable next steps that the user take after completing the quickstart. Always link to conceptual content on the feature or product. You can also link off to other related information on docs.github.com or in GitHub Skills.
